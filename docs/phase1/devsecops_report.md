## 2. Current Threat Landscape

### 2.1 Recent Major Incidents

**tj-actions/changed-files Supply Chain Attack (March 2025)**

The most significant GitHub Actions compromise of 2025 occurred when attackers gained unauthorized access to the tj-actions organization through a compromised GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). The attack, assigned CVE-2025-30066 with a CVSS score of 8.6, affected over 23,000 repositories globally.

**Attack Timeline:**

- **November 2024**: Initial compromise believed to have begun, targeting Coinbase
- **March 10-14, 2025**: Malicious commit injected into tj-actions/changed-files
- **March 14, 2025**: Security researchers detected suspicious activity
- **March 19, 2025**: CISA added CVE-2025-30066 to Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog

**Technical Details:**
The attackers modified the repository by:

1. Compromising a GitHub PAT linked to @tj-actions-bot account
2. Injecting a Base64-encoded Python script into the action's code
3. Retroactively updating multiple version tags to reference the malicious commit
4. Disguising commits as originating from renovate[bot] (legitimate automation)
5. Exploiting automatic merge configurations to bypass review

The malicious payload dumped CI/CD secrets from the Runner Worker process memory to workflow logs, exposing:

- AWS access keys and credentials
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- npm authentication tokens
- Private RSA keys
- Environment variables containing sensitive data

**Impact:** 218 repositories confirmed to have leaked secrets, with the majority being GitHub tokens. Organizations using hash-pinned versions were protected unless they updated during the exploitation window.

**reviewdog/action-setup Cascading Attack**

Investigation revealed that tj-actions/changed-files was compromised through a dependency on reviewdog/action-setup, representing a cascading supply chain attack. The attackers:

- Compromised the reviewdog/action-setup v1 tag
- Injected malicious code into install.sh scripts
- Leveraged this access to compromise downstream dependencies

**Broader Context:**

This attack demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of GitHub Actions internals and represents an evolution in supply chain attack techniques. Unlike traditional dependency confusion or typosquatting, these attackers targeted the CI/CD automation layer itself, exploiting trust relationships and automation mechanisms.

## 3. Security Standards and Frameworks

### 3.1 SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

**Overview:**
SLSA (pronounced "salsa") is a comprehensive security framework developed initially by Google and now governed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF). It provides a structured, tiered approach to securing the entire software supply chain.

**Four Security Levels:**

**Level 1 - Build Process Documented:**

- Build process is scripted/automated
- Provenance is generated describing how artifact was built
- Minimal security guarantees, but establishes foundation for verification

**Level 2 - Tamper-Resistant Build:**

- Build service generates provenance with verifiable identity
- Service is hosted (not running on developer's workstation)
- Source and build platform must be available for verification
- Protection against tampering after the build

**Level 3 - Hardened Build Platform:**

- Stricter controls on the build platform
- Isolation between builds
- Provenance is unforgeable
- Automated prevention of configuration drift

**Level 4 - Highest Level of Trust:**

- Two-person review of all changes
- Hermetically sealed builds (no network access during build)
- Comprehensive auditing and verification
- Maximum protection against insider threats

**Key Concepts:**

- **Provenance**: Metadata about how an artifact was built (source location, build command, dependencies)
- **Attestation**: Cryptographically signed provenance
- **Verification**: Process of validating attestations before deployment

**Applicability to GitHub Actions:**
GitHub Actions can achieve SLSA Level 2-3 through:

- Using GitHub-hosted runners (isolated build environments)
- Generating SLSA provenance using actions like slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator
- Implementing artifact signing and verification
- Enforcing branch protection and required reviews

### 3.2 NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)

**Document:** NIST SP 800-218

**Purpose:** Provides fundamental secure software development practices organized into four high-level categories.

**Four Practice Groups:**

**1. Prepare the Organization (PO)**

- Define security requirements for software development
- Implement secure development training
- Establish secure coding standards and guidelines
- Define and use secure environments for software development

**2. Protect the Software (PS)**

- Protect components from tampering and unauthorized access
- Archive and protect provenance for components
- Maintain cryptographic protection for authentication and integrity

**3. Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)**

- Design software with security in mind
- Review and analyze code for security
- Verify third-party software components
- Securely configure software
- Test executable code for security

**4. Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)**

- Identify and confirm vulnerabilities
- Assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities
- Analyze vulnerabilities to identify root causes

**Integration with CI/CD:**
NIST SSDF focuses on organizational practices and SDLC processes, providing the "what" that should be secured. It complements SLSA, which provides technical "how" guidance for implementation.

### 3.3 NIST SP 800-204D

**Title:** Strategies for the Integration of Software Supply Chain Security in DevSecOps CI/CD Pipelines

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Secure Build Process**: Isolated environments, strict policies, attestations
- **Secrets Management**: Automated detection, secure storage, rotation
- **Dependency Oversight**: SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, version pinning
- **Artifact Integrity**: Signing, verification, immutable storage
- **Access Control**: RBAC, least privilege, audit logging

**Mapping to SLSA:**
NIST SP 800-204D requirements map directly to SLSA levels, providing implementation guidance for achieving SLSA compliance in government and regulated environments.

## 7. Conclusion

The DevSecOps ecosystem faces significant and evolving threats, as evidenced by the recent supply chain attacks and the statistics showing dramatic increases in attack frequency and sophistication. GitHub Actions and similar CI/CD platforms are prime targets due to their privileged access to source code, secrets, and production environments.

However, established frameworks (SLSA, NIST SSDF, OWASP Top 10 CI/CD) provide comprehensive guidance for securing these critical systems. The key challenge lies not in the absence of standards, but in their consistent implementation and the balance between security and development velocity.

This project will focus on practical implementation of these security controls, with GitHub Actions as the primary platform, to demonstrate how organizations can secure their CI/CD pipelines effectively while maintaining the agility that modern development practices demand.

**Next Phase Deliverables:**

- Detailed threat model using STRIDE methodology
